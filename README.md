# Boston-Housing
Machine Learning project utilizing Random Forest Regressor to train a model predicting Boston housing prices. 

Code was written in Python 3.7.2. 

This project applies some of the practices found in Chapter 2 of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow" 
by Auerelien Geron. 

The focus of this project is to work on the following:
